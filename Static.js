// The eval() function in JavaScript is a powerful and somewhat controversial feature that evaluates a string of JavaScript
//  code in the context of the current execution environment. While it can be very useful, 
// it should be used with caution due to potential security risks and performance implications.
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let result = eval('x+y');

console.log(result); // Output: 30
